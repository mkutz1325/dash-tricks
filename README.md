Current Status
==============

We need to put together a presentation for Wednesday.
This should include:

1.  What problem is being being solved.
2.  Who is the 'customer' - who will use the product.
3.  What are the key constraints/requirements.
4.  What is the workflow/user interface for your application.  Illustrate with screenshots/paper prototypes,  etc.
5.  What is the architecture of your system.
6.  What is your work plan.

We need to talk about the use cases of the app, including:

- Viewing Refrigerator capacity / Usage / Status
- Monitoring Refrigerator Status (temp)
- Viewing Immunization Coverage
- Monitoring Vaccine Stocks / Stock levels / Stock out
- Viewing Reporting times, missing data
- Saving Charts to make reports

We should also have a data model sketch for Wednesday, possibly based on the PATH_DataModel document in the TanzaniaApp folder.
