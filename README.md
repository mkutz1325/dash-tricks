Current Status
==============

We need to put together a presentation for Wednesday.
This should include:

1.  What problem is being being solved.
2.  Who is the 'customer' - who will use the product.
3.  What are the key constraints/requirements.
4.  What is the workflow/user interface for your application.  Illustrate with screenshots/paper prototypes,  etc.
5. What is the architecture of your system.
6.  What is your work plan.

We should also have a data model sketch for Wednesday, possibly based on the PATH_DataModel document in the TanzaniaApp folder.
