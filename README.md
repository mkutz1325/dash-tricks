A collection of health indicators and tools for District Immunization Managers in Tanzania.

Build Instructions
==================

Using Android: 4.4.2
Installed with ADT Eclipse bundle

Eclipse should build the project automatically

The first time the app launches there is about a 5 min
load time as the csv data files are parsed and inserted
into the SQL database on the device

After that subsequent launches should have minimal load time
and subsequent re-load/launches from eclipse should be much faster
